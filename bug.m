In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management. If an observer is not removed before the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This is because the observer might try to access the memory of the already deallocated object.

@end

@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
